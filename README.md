## Three.js NextJS Template!

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

or

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

The most important files are:

- `index.js` — where we load the Three.JS scene into a canvas by using a hook
- `threejs/ThreeApp.js` — where all the magic happens

Let me know if u have any question! I can also give u a quick tour anytime!!
